A program I made to play around with an online word guessing game (https://skribbl.io/)
Chooses all words that fit the blanks and automatically types them out (with delays to prevent being caught by the anti-spam system)
Only works if the word list is known and is typed into words.txt

How to use:
copy the set of blanks (ex. ____ ___) to clipboard
run guesser.jar and click on the input space of the text box on skribbl
